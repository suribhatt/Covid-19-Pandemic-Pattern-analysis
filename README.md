Covid-19-Pandemic-Pattern
This data is imported from kaggle and was used to see the patterns of covid 19 in different countries for a specific time duration. The data helped me to understand which country is most affected, which one have most deaths and recovered as well. I am sharing Microsoft POWER BI based report and dashboard which can be utilized to see:

1- Most affected countries 2- Most deaths by region 3- Most cases by region 4- Most recoveries by region/ 5- Cases, deaths, recovered per country and city as well
